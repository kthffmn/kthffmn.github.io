# About

A full stack web developer and current [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/) instructor, I work with Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, and JavaScript. My background is in early childhood education and I hold a BA in psychology from Columbia University, Barnard College. Though Brooklyn-based, I hail from Denver, CO and accidentally refer to the region as the west coast, instead of the west, because words just sound better when "coast"¬ù follows themcoast.
